//note: We already have an Article data class from the previous lab,
// and we now have an ArticleEntity data class for our database.
// Unfortunately these classes don't quite match up...
// so it makes passing the data around complicated.
// To make it easier for ourselves, it's standard to create a common data class.
// Create a new Kotlin file DisplayArticle.kt and let's create the
// simplest data class of the Article type that we can

data class DisplayArticle(
    val headline: String?,
    val abstract: String?,
    val byline: String?,
    val mediaImageUrl: String?
) : java.io.Serializable
